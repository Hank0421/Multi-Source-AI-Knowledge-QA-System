# Multi-Source-AI-Knowledge-QA-System
This project is a multi-modal and multi-source knowledge Q&amp;A system demo. It integrates various data sources such as PDF, Word, plain text, CSV, and images, and combines vector databases (FAISS, Qdrant) with multiple embedding models (HuggingFace, Google Gemini, SentenceTransformer) for semantic search and generative AI Q&amp;A.
